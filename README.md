## DATA PRE-PROCESSING

### Data Loading
```Python
##  importing all the necessary python packages


# solution 

import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

print("The packages have been successfully imported")
```

```Python
# reading the sales data into the pandas dataframe

# Solution

bikes_df =  pd.read_csv("C:/Users/HP/Desktop/_EXCLUSIVE DATA SCIENCE BOOT CAMP_STUDENT FOLDER/_DATASET/bikes.csv")

bikes_df.head()
```

###  Data Modification
```Python
# Adding the following 3 columns; TotalCostPrice, SalesRevenue, Profit.



# TotalCostPrice : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x CostPrice_usd)


bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["CostPrice_usd"] 





# SalesRevenue : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x SellingPrice_usd)


bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["SellingPrice_usd"] 



# Profit : To be obtained by (SalesRevenue - TotalCostPrice)



bikes_df["Profit"] = bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] - bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"]


bikes_df.head()
```


## DATA ANALYSIS

### Data Filtering
```Python
# Filtering out only the data relevant to solving the problem statement

USA = bikes_df["CustomerCountry"] == "United States"

bikes_df[(USA)]

USA_Customers = bikes_df[(USA)]

USA_Customers
```

### Data Aggregation
```Python
# Aggregating the Filtered Data for Each USA customer

USA_Customers.pivot_table( values = 'Profit', index = 'CustomerName', aggfunc = np.sum)

Customer_Total_Profit = USA_Customers.pivot_table( values = 'Profit', index = 'CustomerName', aggfunc = np.sum)

Customer_Total_Profit
```

### Data Sorting
```Python
Customer_Total_Profit.sort_values("Profit", ascending = False)
```

## RESULT
```Python
Customer_Total_Profit.sort_values("Profit", ascending = False).head(10)

Top_10_Customers = Customer_Total_Profit.sort_values("Profit", ascending = False).head(10)

Top_10_Customers
```

## VISUALIZATION
```Python
# Visualizing The Result

# Ploting
Top_10_Customers.plot(kind = 'bar')

# Adding Title, and Labels
plt.title('The Top Ten (10) Customers in the United States')

plt.ylabel('Total Profit')

plt.xlabel('Customer Name')

# Showing the Result
plt.show()
```
